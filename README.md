## Features

1. ⚡ extremely lightweight (~3.1kb)
2. 🛒 a simple, promise-based API for interfacing with the cart
3. 🔮 automatic polyfill loading where needed thanks to [pollyfill.io](pollyfill.io)

## Getting started

smolcart.js can be used with NPM or through a CDN; whichever best fits your workflow.

### Install using NPM

1. open your project and run

```bash
npm install --save smolcart.js
```

2. in the file where you'd like to use smolcart:

```js
import { init } from 'smolcart.js'

// initialize smolcart.js, this will load polyfills if they're needed.
const cart = init();

// now you can dynamically interact with your cart!
await cart.addItems([{id: '1234', quantity: 1]);
const cartdata = await cart.getCart();
```

3. you're good to go! more docs coming soon

### Install using a CDN

1. open the template you'd like to add smolcart.js to
2. create a script tag that has `src` attribute pointing to the newest version of smolcart.js on a CDN (we recommend unpkg)

```html
<script
  src="https://unpkg.com/smolcart.js@latest/dist/smolcart.umd.min.js"
  defer
></script>
```

3. after the script has loaded, you should be able to initialize smolcart.js:

```js
// initialize smolcart.js, this will load polyfills if they're needed.
const cart = window.smolcart.init();

// now you can dynamically interact with your cart!
await cart.addItems([{id: '1234', quantity: 1]);
const cartdata = await cart.getCart();
```
